# The-Royal-Family-optimized-modpack
A Minecraft modpack specifically for the members of The Royal Family

I specifically made this to make life easier for me and you<br/>
This makes it so that you don't have to download mods one by one and instead just install Minecraft already modded and ready for playing!<br/>
Most mods are optimization mods with a tiny bit of quality of life mods
